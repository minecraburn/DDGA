# codes for DDGA

This is the code for the diffusion decomposition of Gaussian approximation (DDGA), an effective approximation approach for quantifying the landscape of oscillatory systems with varying dimensions.

The three folders correspond to the three figures in our article. If you are interested in the details, the codes in the three folders can help you reproduce the results of the three figures in our article. If you are only interested in our methods, files `./Figure3/land_DDGA.m` will serve as an example of the application of our methods in a 44-dimensional mammalian cell cycle network system, and help you understand how our methods work.

For the latter purpose, run all the blocks in `./Figure3/land_DDGA.m` in order. For the former purpose, run all the blocks in `./Figure1/KL_limit3_Dchange_revised.m`,`./Figure2/Coherence_Fluxintloop_Repressilator.m`,`./Figure3/Gaussian_45_dim.m`,`./Figure3/land_DDGA.m` in order, separately. Also, the code in `./Figure3/cc45flux.nb` offers another format `.nb' in Mathematica, provided from [Li 2014 PNAS].

See details in the files.
